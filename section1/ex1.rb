puts "Hello World!"
#puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
#puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
#puts "This is another line."

#Study Drills
#1. Make your script print another line.
  #- I added "puts 'This is another line.'" at the very end.
#2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
  #- I used an octothorpe to in front of each line except one.
#3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
  #- An octothorpe made ruby ignore the code following it.
