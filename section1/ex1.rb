#puts "Hello World!"
#puts "Hello Again"
#puts "I like typing this."
#puts "This is fun."
#puts "Yay! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'"
#puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'

#1) Make your script print another line.
puts "Here's another line for ya"

#2) Make your script print only one of the lines.
# I did this by using an octothorpe to block out the previous lines

#3)Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
# This character will make the text following it not show up as code. It can be
# used to make notes or tell ruby not to pay attention to a line of code.
