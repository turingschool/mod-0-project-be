#puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
#puts "This is another line."

Study Drills
1. Make your script print another line.
  - I added "puts 'This is another line.'" at the very end.
2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
  - I used an octothorpe to in front of each line except one.
3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
  - An octothorpe made ruby ignore the code following it.
