Exercise
print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."

Study Drills
1. Go online and find out what Rubys gets.chomp does.
  - I found that the "gets" creates a new line and asks the user to input a integer, variable, float, etc. and gets.chomp does the same thing except that it does not create a new line. gets.chomp allows a user to input as well as "gets", but there will not be a new line that is added after the string.

2. Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.
You can use it ask questions to the user, play a game or run through the game play, you can use it to have users put their own information into the code.

3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.

print "What is your favorite food?"
food = gets.chomp
print "What dessert do you like?"
dessert = gets.chomp
print "What would you like to drink?"
drink = gets.chomp

puts "So, you like #{food}, you would like #{dessert} and want #{drink} for a drink."
