#Exercise
print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."

#Study Drills
#1. Go online and find out what Rubys gets.chomp does.
  #- I found that the "gets" creates a new line and asks the user to input a integer, variable, float, etc. and gets.chomp does the same thing except that it does not create a new line. gets.chomp allows a user to input as well as "gets", but there will not be a new line that is added after the string.

#2. Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.
#You can use it ask questions to the user, play a game or run through the game play, you can use it to have users put their own information into the code.

#3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.

#print "What is your favorite food?"
#food = gets.chomp
#print "What dessert do you like?"
#dessert = gets.chomp
#print "What would you like to drink?"
#drink = gets.chomp

#puts "So, you like #{food}, you would like #{dessert} and want #{drink} for a drink."
