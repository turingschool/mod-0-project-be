## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to want to work it out myself so I often wait too long before asking for help.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
print ' "Hello World!"'


3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
A pound #

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a whole number and a float has decimal places.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = '"zebra"'

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
print animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is inserting a variable into a string. An example could be this:
print "Colleen loves to go to the zoo to get a glimpse of any #{animal} she can."

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
get.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
.split is a method used to separate a string at a space. Further you can decide a different approach by specifying another delimiting factor by adding (",") after .split if the factor is a comma.

.length is a method used to determine the number of characters in a string.
