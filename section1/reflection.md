## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
# I tend to wait too long. And that is a habit I am learning to
2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
puts 'Hello world!'
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file? # octothorpe, hashtag, pound etc

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float? # an integer will stay the same, a float is used to indicate potential change.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
puts "that #{animal} is rainbow colors!"

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
A string that contains multiple related variables.
animal = 'dog'
puts "the best companion is life is an #{animal}!"
8. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
 string length-how to tell how many charactes (maybe) are in a string.
 interpolation-using multiple variables to create a string.
