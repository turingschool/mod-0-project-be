## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
i feel pretty at ease with asking questions. in second grade, my teacher nicknamed me the "Queen of Questions". Perhaps I ask questions too soon more often than waiting too long (at work anyway - my personal life is another matter)

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
puts "Hello World!" in my .rb file, save file, call file in terminal with ruby <filename>.rb (first making sure I was in the correct directory)

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
octothorpe #

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
integers are whole numbers and floats carry out past the decimal (3 - integer vs. 3.14159 - float)

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
interpolation inserts variables into strings, other variables, etc.
puts "#{animal}s have stripes"

gets (gets.chomp removes the /n)
