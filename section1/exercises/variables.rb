# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
forbidden_task = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p forbidden_task

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p "#{students + 2}"

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p "#{students - 2}"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Nicole"
is_hungry = "not hungry right now"
number_of_pets = 3

p "Hello! My name is #{first_name}. I ordered pizza, but I'm #{is_hungry}. I have #{number_of_pets} dogs that would like to eat the pizza."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# I declared three variables and defined each variable with facts about myself.

# Explain.

# Once I declared and defined my variables. I decided to string them together to make a couple of sentences.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Bob"
is_hungry = "starving"
number_of_pets = "two"

p "My friend #{first_name} told me that he is #{is_hungry}, and would eat the food of his #{number_of_pets} cats."


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p "I have #{healthy_snacks} healthy snacks and #{junk_food_snacks} not so heathy snacks. In total I have #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks} snacks for you to try."

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?

# I did and I was pleased with the results
