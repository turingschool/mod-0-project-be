# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf_warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p house_elf_warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
new_students = 2
puts students - new_students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Elizabeth"
is_hungry = "Time to make dinner!"
number_of_pets = 3

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
p "I decided to use these data types based on the variable names provided and what seems like you would expect to be attached."

# Explain.
p "The variable 'first_name' would inticate a string is needed to provid the first name of the user."
p "The variable 'is_hungry' would suggest that somthing to do with food wich would also be a text string should be associated with the name."
p "The variable 'number_of_pets' states that it is a number value and I chose to keep it an intiger vs a sring character for a number b/c this sounds like somthing that could change over time."

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "JoAnna"
is_hungry = "Loves Banana's!"
number_of_pets = 6

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets



# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
