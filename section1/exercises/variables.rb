# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
puts "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = 22 + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22 - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
first_name = Wilford
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 13

# IN WORDS:
# I gave the first one a name because..name. A boolean seemed most appropriate for
# second, because there are times when the subject may not always be hungry.
# It is an integer becuase you can never have a partial pet.

# Explain.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = Thomas
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
 puts "When I add #{healthy_snacks} + #{junk_food_snacks}, I get #{healthy_snacks +
 junk_food_snacks}."

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?Yes!
