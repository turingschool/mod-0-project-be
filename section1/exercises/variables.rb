# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_says = "#{name} must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobby_says

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Wes"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 0
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.

# The first_name is a text string so I used quotes around my name.
# The is_hungry seemed to be a question in which the answer could be answered by a Boolean true or false so I responded with how I am feeling right now
# The number_of_pets would be an integer response so all that was needed here was a number. Unfortunately my dog passed in October and she was the sweetest, best, goodest girl ever. I'm still pretty broken up about it, tbh.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Wesley"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = -1
puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

# puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
# OR ...
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
puts total_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
# true
