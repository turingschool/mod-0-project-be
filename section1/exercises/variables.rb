# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
snape = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p snape
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Kevin"
is_hungry = "always"
number_of_pets = "one"

puts "The student #{first_name} has a big appetite #{is_hungry} and has #{number_of_pets} dog."


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

#
# Explain.
# I used the data type that could represent the variables related to me and that would make sense.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
Kevin = 'male'
always = 'all day'
one = "corgi"

puts "The #{Kevin} student seems to eat #{always} with his pet #{one}."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p "The number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
# Everything came out correct with no errors.

#Refactor check
