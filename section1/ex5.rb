puts "Actually that's not too heavy."
puts "She's got #{myeyes} eyes and #{myhair} hair."
puts "Her teeth are usually #{myteeth} depending on the coffee."

#this line is a little tricky, try to get it exactly right
puts "If I add #{my_age}, #{my_height}, and #{my_weight} I get #{my_age + my_height + my_weight}."

#Study Drills
#1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

#2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.
#irb(main):004:0> 12 * 5
#=> 60
#irb(main):005:0> 2.54 * 69
#=> 175.26
#irb(main):006:0>


#irb(main):006:0> 135 * 0.454
#=> 61.29
#irb(main):007:0>
