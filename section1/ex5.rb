Exercise
myname = "Kaelin E. Sleevi"
myage = 23 #not a lie in 2009
myheight = 175.26 #centimeters
myweight = 61.29 #kilograms
myeyes = 'Blue/Green/Yellow'
myteeth = 'White'
myhair = 'Red'

puts "Let's talk about #{myname}."
puts "She's #{myheight} inches tall."
puts "She's #{myweight} pounds heavy."
puts "Actually that's not too heavy."
puts "She's got #{myeyes} eyes and #{myhair} hair."
puts "Her teeth are usually #{myteeth} depending on the coffee."

#this line is a little tricky, try to get it exactly right
puts "If I add #{my_age}, #{my_height}, and #{my_weight} I get #{my_age + my_height + my_weight}."

Study Drills
1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.
irb(main):004:0> 12 * 5
=> 60
irb(main):005:0> 2.54 * 69
=> 175.26
irb(main):006:0>


irb(main):006:0> 135 * 0.454
=> 61.29
irb(main):007:0>
