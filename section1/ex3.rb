# 2) Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and,
# using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator. 👍🏼
# 3) Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.

# 4) Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is
# floating point. 👍🏼
