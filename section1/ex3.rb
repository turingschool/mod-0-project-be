#Exercise
#prints the statement so I know what the code/equation is doing
puts "I will now count my chickens:"
#the amount of hens and roosters(integer) are calculated by the equation below
puts "Hens #{25 + 30 / 6}"
puts "Roosters #{100 - 25 * 3.0 % 4.0}"
#prints a statment to know what the code/equation is now calculating
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"
#this equation calculates the amount of eggs into one integer/amount
puts 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.2 + 4.0 % 2.1 - 1.3 / 4.0 + 6.5
#asking a true or false question based on the equations
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
#calculates this question in the equation to tell us if it is true or false
puts 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.2 - 7.3
#both line 16 and 17 are asking ruby to calculate the equations below.
puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3.0 + 2.0}"
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5.2 - 7.3}"
#this line loops back to the question on line 12. After the equations are calculated it is telling you that your asnwer is why the equation is false
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."
#prints a statement letting us know we are going to do more calculations
puts "How about some more."
#lines 23, 24, 25 are asking if eeach statement is true or false based on the calculations
puts "Is it greater? #{5.2 > -2.0}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5.2 >= -2.0}"
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5.2 <= -2.0}"

#Study Drills
#1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
#2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and, using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
#3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
#4. Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
