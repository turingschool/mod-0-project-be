#Exercises

#Use IRB to store values with each of the following variable names. Which names are good, which are actually invalid Ruby, and which are valid but go against Ruby style?
#1. time_machine:
  #- This is a good variable, it gives a descripton of the variable and uses snake_case.
#2. student_count_integer:
  #- This could be a good variable, but the "integer" part is not necessary. The student count will be an integer either way. You can make it shorter without the excess word.
#3. homeworkAssignment
  #- This is a bad variable and is invalid in ruby. It uses camel_case rather than snake_case. It should be homework_assignment
#4. 3_sections
  #- This is a bad variable and is invalid in ruby. To name your variable it can not be named starting with an interger. It should be three_sections.
#4. top_ppl
  #- This is a bad variable and is invalid in ruby. The word "ppl" is an abbreviation rather than using "people". It should be top_people.

#String methods

.split and .length
  irb(main):001:0> name = "Kaelin Elizabeth Sleevi"
  => "Kaelin Elizabeth Sleevi"
  irb(main):002:0> name.length
  => 23
  irb(main):003:0> name.split
  => ["Kaelin", "Elizabeth", "Sleevi"]
  irb(main):004:0> numbers = "one,two,three,four,five"
  => "one,two,three,four,five"
  irb(main):005:0> numbers.split
  => ["one,two,three,four,five"]
  irb(main):006:0> numbers.split(",")
  => ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]
  irb(main):007:0>

#Combining strings and variables

name = "Kaelin Elizabeth Sleevi"
  puts "Good morning," + name + "!"

- executing code inside interpolation
modifier = "very"
mood = "excited"
puts "I am #{modifier * 3 + mood} for today's class"

#Compare the methos list for proper string versus:
#1. "hello".methods
  #- In the string method before, you would use the method attached to the variable, but not the variables assignment to a string.
#2. "hello".methods.count
  #- The mthod is again being attached to a string and not the variable that is assigned to the string. There are also two methods attached.
#3. :hello.methods
  #- Uses a symbol as the vairable that is a broken down string. Yet aagin not assigning a method to the variable.
#4. :hello.methods.count
  #- Uses a symbol as a variable and two methods again

#Repeating instructions
  5. times do
    puts "Hello,World!"
  end
 #- Hello,World!
  #Hello,World!
  #Hello,World!
  #Hello,World!
  #Hello,World!
#Above is also an example of a ruby block. It has a command, and output, and an end. Usually starting with do.
