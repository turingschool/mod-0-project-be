## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The idea of having a growth mindset or framing it that was is a newer concept to me. I often feel complacent and the need to do something else to get away from that feeling but to frame is as moving towards a positive instead of a negative place is new! I also appreciated learning that people with growth mindsets don’t avoid challenges and they’re more likely to seek them out.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I avoid feeling settled and often seek out new challenges. I’ve often taken on improving things that were working just fine but making them better just keep growing. I sometimes feel like I am restricted like theres a barrier that i can't quite pass through but I often remind myself that anyone can do anything with enough effort to try to push past that feeling.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement gives direction to perform an instruction under certain conditions.
  1. If animal = cow
      p "this animal moos"
    else
      p "this animal doesn't moo"

  2. If name = kristen
      p "this is Kristen"
    else
      p "this is not Kristen"

  3. If number_cost <= 5
      p "this is inexpensive"
    else
      p "this is too expensive"


4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

You may want to use an if-statement when you are defining a condition of a variable.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if variableX = 2
  p "this variable is equal to 2"
else
  p "this variable is not equal to 2"
end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can use elseif to add additional conditions to an if-statement

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if variableX = 2
  p "this variable is equal to 2"
elseif variableX = 4
  p "this variable is equal to 4"
elseif variableX = 6
  p "this variable is equal to 6"
else
  p "this variable is not equal to 2, 4 or 6"
end
