## Section 2 Reflection
------------------------
1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-I resonated with the seeking out challenges point. Many times in my life before the age of 18 I would avoid being challenged. I did not begin to understand taking on challenges until the  age of 18. I reflected on how much I have changed in the past five years by being challenged and push.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
The ways I do demonstrate a growth mindset
- seeking out challenges.
- understanding my mistakes are a part of the learning process and to not be afraid to make mistakes while in the learning process.
The way I do _not_
- practicing goals. I have always struggled with setting realistic and relevant goals.
- seeking help. Most of my life I have relied entirely on myself. I have issues admitting the need for help in many situations.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Three examples:
  - if cats >= dogs
  - if cats == dogs
  - if cats < dogs

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- based on what you are working on you might want to test if the conditionals are true in your code for your project or company.
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
- if conditional [then]
code...
[elsif conditional [then]
code...]...
[else
code...]
end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- elsif, else

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
- for example:
if predators > prey
  puts "We won't survive against them."
elsif predators < prey
  puts "We could survive against them for awhile."
else
  puts "We will just hide."
end
