## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- The SMART goals was something that I used in my previous job and so this jumped out at me, though I never thought to apply the SMART goals to my personal life.
- The other thing that resonated with me was that I fully believe that everyone can improve their skills with practice. I actually think that most people share this idea of the growth mindset, but they are just too depressed to care about improving, which I totally understand and wish there was an easy answer for.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

So there are two ways that I feel i regularly demonstrate the growth mindset: as I mentioned before, I think everyone is capable of improving their skills and I know that mistakes are essential to learning...however, the two areas where I struggle the most with the growth mindset is not seeking out challenges and not asking for help when I do make the aforementioned inevitable mistakes. If I'm being honest with myself, and I always try to be, I cycle through a negative feedback loop of my own making where I feel like figuring something out on my own is challenging enough so I don't ask for help when I may need it, but if I'm unsuccessful at fixing the issue it can be discouraging and makes me not want to seek out anything more challenging, even after the issue is eventually solved, because it was so emotionally draining putting myself through that stress. Of course being aware of this doesn't mean I can solve it, but I definitely will try to break out of that mindset while at Turing. A perfect opportunity for concurrent professional and emotional development!

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is something that can either be `true` or `false`. Common conditional operators are `==` (double-equal), `>` (greater-than), `>=` (greater-than-equal), `<` (less-than), and `<=` (less-than-equal). A few examples would be using the double-equal to test whether a coin toss landed on heads, using the greater-than-equal to test whether you have enough money to buy groceries, or using the less-than to know if you're going to get a tax return based on your income bracket. These conditional tests can be used in if-statements to return the correct string for the data you are testing.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

You would use an if-statement if you wanted to print two or more different messages or options based on either user input or data that you might be testing the validity of.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

The syntax for a Ruby if-statement is `if`/`elsif`/`else`.

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You add multiple conditions to an if-statement by using `elsif`.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

````Ruby
if variable_1 = true
  puts "variable_1 is true"
elsif variable_1 = false
  puts "variable_1 is false"
else
  puts "variable_1 is neither true nor false"
end
````
