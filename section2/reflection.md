## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
1.) Imposter syndrome-I feel this constantly, and am working so hard to get out of that mindset. I deserve to be here, and need to trust that.
2.) Keeping track of my own progress and *not* other peoples. Everyone is starting from a different place, and has a vast array of life experience and knowledge. In reflecting about these two points, I believe they are related to each other, and also stemming from a place of my own insecurity.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I sit with the uncomfortable feelings of change instead of suppressing them and moving along. Acknowledging those uncomfortable, icky feelings and understanding why I am feeling that way helps me to progress toward the change and growth that is coming to me. This is a skill that I am working to grow in every aspect of my life. Feelings are good to feel, even if they are uncomfortable or heavy. I struggle with a growth mindset personally, in my everyday life. How do I show up better for myself? What things am I doing for myself to keep my mental health right, or pushing myself to grow? I am a creature of habit, and breaking those old unhealthy habits that have kept me complacent has never been more important to me than it is now.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement means to evaluate true or false, if certain conditions are met. Three examples of this would be:
  Defining variables to decide how many cups of coffee someone needs to drink after a certain number of hours of sleep.
  If there are enough bottles of water to keep everyone hydrated.
  If someone is of the legal age to buy alcohol on a website.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You would want to use an if statement if you need the conditions to be met in order for the results to be true.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

variables
<br>
if condition
<br>
  puts ""
  <br>
end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
if condition

variables
  else
    puts ""
  elsif
    puts ""
  end  
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
capacity = 1000
<br>
people = 950


if people > capacity
<br>
  puts "entry will not be granted"
 <br>
elsif people < capacity
<br>
  puts "entry will be granted"
 <br>
else
<br>
  puts "we lost count"
<br>
end
