## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-One thing that resonated with me was to face a challenge head on. This has proven to be effective and rewarding in my past studies. A new strategy to me is to set measurable and time-bound goals. I think this is an important skill for my future projects.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
-I am comfortable with challenges and seeking help when needed. I am not quite used to breaking down assignments into smaller chunks and block out time for them.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
-A conditional statement is written in the form "If P then Q." Some examples include: if not A then B. If C then D. If not B, then not A.
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
-I would use an if-statement to check a condition or there are more than one outcomes depending on the if-statement.
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if conditional
  code...
elsif conditional
  code...
else
    code...
end
```
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
-By using 'elsif' and 'else'
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if num>4
  puts #{num} ">4"
elsif num=4
  puts #{num} "=4"
else
  puts #{num} "<4"
end
```
