## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    - Growth mindset can be cultivated by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
    - **S.M.A.R.T. goalsÂ -** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I am always learning, always curious, and have only felt that my biggest hurdle to learning something new is time and money. I can fall into fixed mindset spirals when things are going poorly.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a block of code that determines whether or not the parameters set forth are true or false.

if 1 > 2
  puts "What the heck?"
else
  puts "All is right in the world."
end

if 1 < 2 ? puts "true" ; puts "false"

if 1 == 2 || 2 == 2
  puts "This works."
else
  puts "nope."
end


4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
To aid decision making to help ensure the right outcome within a program depending on the context.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if (condition)
  (outcome)
elsif (another condition)
  (another outcome)
else
  (a different outcome)
end

if / (elsif) / (else) / end

If the conditional statement is short, you can write it as a single line. If the conditional statement is longer, it will be written in multiple lines.


6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
by using elsif and/or else


7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
I did this in number 5 and number 3.
