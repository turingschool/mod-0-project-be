# Section 2 - GROWTH MINDSET, Conditionals

Section 2 is estimated to take a total of 8-12 hours to complete. Similar to Section 1, this section of the project involves üìíreading, üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

## Vocabulary

This section will introduce a number of new terms, that may feel a bit more complex. Write these terms in that special spot in your notebook now. Work to hold yourself accountable to updating definitions _as you work through this section_.

- if statements
- method

## Get Set Up

Using the Terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the project repository. If you are having trouble with this, see the `section1` instructions.

## Part A: Growth Mindset

Read/watch one or both of the following:
- This [2-part blog post series](https://blog.mindsetworks.com/entry/how-having-a-growth-mindset-can-help-you-learn-to-code) discusses how having a growth mindset is helpful when learning to code, and how coding promotes a growth mindset!
- This [video interview](https://dev.to/hackflix_dev/how-to-hack-a-growth-mindset-b1g) where an experienced Front-End engineer discusses learning about the concept of Growth Mindset and how that's changed how she sees her work and career. (The first 7 minutes are intros and a discussion on Developer Relations. After that, the conversation about Growth Midnset begins.)

Then, consider on the following questions. We will ask you to share some of these responses at the end of this section.
- What are two points from the article or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?

## Part B: Conditionals

One of the most important concepts in computer programming is knowing when and how to tell the computer to do either _one_ thing or _another_ thing based on a set of simple criteria.  We accomplish this with ***If-Statements*** and ***Conditionals***, which you will learn about today.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to GitHub.

### If statement and Conditional Lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    - [x] [What If?](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex29.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Else and If](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex30.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Making Decisions](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex31.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Conditionals](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#9.-conditionals) from Ruby in 100 Minutes.

1. Work through the `if_statements.rb` file in the `section2/exercises` directory.

## Vocabulary

Look back at that special spot in your notebook for vocabulary. Hopefully you updated it with definitions, diagrams, and code samples as you went through this section. If not, do so now. This will be part of this sections deliverables.

## Reflections

üìù Answer the prompts in the `reflection.md` file in the `section2` directory. If you need a reminder on how to format your markdown, [this is the Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!

## Commit Your Work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section2` activities, use the Terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local Git repository.

1. `git add section2/exercises`
2. `git add section2/reflection.md`
3. `git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
4. `git commit -m "Add Section 2 work"`

## Push to GitHub

You've saved your work to Git on your local machine, but your repository on GitHub doesn't reflect it yet. You update the remote GitHub repository with your new local commits when you `push` your changes.

Run:

```
git push origin main
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote repository and see all the work you did in this section!
