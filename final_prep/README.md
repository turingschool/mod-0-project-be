## Refactor Previous Work

You've learned A LOT over the last few weeks as it relates to technical content - chances are, you probably have some code from your previous exercises that is either sloppy, incorrect, poorly named, etc. Before starting Mod 1, we want you to **refactor** your code - which is the process of adjusting or improving your code for readability and accuracy.

Some things to consider as you refactor include...

- Are variable names easy to understand/convey the data type they are assigned to?
- Do all lines of code have proper indentation? Is white space used appropriately and consistently, to promote readability?
- Are proper conventions for capitalization, punctuation, casing, etc. used?

Take your time as you go back and refactor your exercises from each section. We've included a handy checklist for you to go through below.

- [x] I have refactored my `section1` exercises to the best of my ability
- [x] I have refactored my `section2` exercises to the best of my ability
- [x] I have refactored my `section3` exercises to the best of my ability

## Gearing Up for Gear Ups

Gear Up is a part of our curriculum where we talk about topics such as privilege and power, and ethical issues in the tech industry.

## **Group Work Prep**

As part of Turing's project-based learning approach, you will often be working in pairs or larger groups. In order to set yourself (and your team) up for success, it is important to ensure you are prepared to be an equitable contributor and teammate.

## Time Management & Lesson Prep

*I've lumped these two sections together, as they are one and the same for me.* 

Before Mod 0 started, I created a system to help ensure my success. I continue to maintain and improve this system as I progress through each session. Below is a bit about the system I use...

### Tools:
1. [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/)
  - Notion is a powerful markdown editor that includes features like relational databases and an open API. 
  - I use Notion as my primary "point of contact" for all things Turing, including:
    + As a gathering place for all in-class lessons
    + As a gathering place for anything assigned via Trello
    + As a place to store and access vocabulary notes
    + As a place to track any questions that arise
    + As a task-managment/project tracking system
    + As a calendar for important due dates
    + As a way to track and access relevant contact information as it relates to Turing
    + As a place to track and share resources I come across
    + As a blog to help me review and remember new or important concepts as I learn them
  - That's a lot of things, I know. [I'll provide a glimpse into how this works for me in the short video below.](#below-is-a-short-video-that-shows-how-i-use-notion-for-turing)
2. [**Rocketbooks**](https://getrocketbook.com/)
  - Rocketbooks are reusable notebooks. You can write and erase as many times as you want on its pages, and each page is able to be uploaded or sent to a location or recipient of your choice. The scanning system itself can act as a table of contents of sorts. I also purchased some of their index cards, but later realized this was a waste of money when I found...
3. [**Cardless**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cardless-future-of-credit/id1532270655)
  - Cardless is an app that uses your phone's camera to scan any index card into your phone. You can save the index cards into categories however you see fit. It uses a spaced repetition system to aid learning, but it's mostly a way for me to study on-the-go if I'm waiting around somewhere.
4. Index Cards!
  - Sometimes low-tech is the best tech. Index cards help me reinforce new concepts and terminoligy. I have mine grouped into categories of "New," "Learning," and "Learned." This helps me know which cards I need to practice the most, and which ones I've successfully recalled the past few times I've gone over them. It also serves as a nice physical, visual reminder of how much I'm learning and how far I've come!

### Below is a short video that shows how I use Notion for Turing:

In Mod 0 you've learned about different techniques for managing your time at Turing. Please create a calendar for your **first 3 weeks of Mod 1**. Feel free to make your calendar fit your style, but we suggest that your calendar should include the following:

- [x] Standard Mod 1 class schedule (find the Mod 1 calendar [on the Back End curriculum site](https://backend.turing.edu/)). The detailed classes held on your actual start date may not yet be posted; you can look back at the previous inning to get a feel for what Weeks 1-3 will be like, but know it's not guaranteed to be exactly the same. Also, as you already know, class is held from 9-12 and 1-4MT, Monday-Friday.
- [x] Study/Project work time (usually about 25 hours/week outside of class time)
- [x] Personal, Health + Wellness

When you are finished, add screenshots of your calendar so we can provide feedback if needed!

- `Add Week 1 Screenshot Here`
- `Add Week 2 Screenshot Here`
- `Add Week 3 Screenshot Here`

## **Lesson Prep**

You've learned a lot about how to take strong notes during Mod 0. Show us your skills while you learn how to pre-teach content for your first lesson in Mod 1!

  ![create new pr](/images/be_s3.png)

## Next Steps

As you wrap up Mod 0, this is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this project.

You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours per day coding.

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...

- What are you going to work on?
- What days are you going to work?
- What times on those days are you going to work?
- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

### Extensions
