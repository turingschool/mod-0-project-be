# Section 3 - HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME, Arrays and Hashes

Section 3 is estimated to take a total of 6-10 hours to complete. Similar to the previous sections, this section of the project involves üìíreading, üë©üèª‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

Since Arrays are a bigger topic, it is the main focus of this section. Some review work from the first two sections has been woven in so you get opportunities to continue seeing and applying those concepts as well.

- value

## Get Set Up

Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup. To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the project repository.

## Part A: How You Spend Your Time

One challenge developers face, more-so when they are starting out, is estimating how long something will take. Sometimes we don't account for merge conflicts, bugs, annoying Slack messages, and all the other things that interrupt our workflow or slow us down.

One challenge learners in a new environment/content area face is feeling like they know nothing, and until they know everything, they feel like they are failing.

So this week, we would like you to start self-monitoring your progress. Before you start on the technical work, reflect back on how the project has gone so far.

- Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?
The time estimates have felt sufficient but I have allotted enough time to experimant and tinker with things which I think is a luxury I might not have if I had children or other obligations outside of my full time job.

- When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?
I have a clear goal of what I want to get done but in no specific amount of time. That being said I have had plenty of time for leisure as well as time to accomplish my educational goals. I should be more dilligent in creating specific time blocks though to ensure I am using my time wisely as opposed to freestyling my schedule.

- How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4 hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?
I think I work best in closer to four hour blocks when it comes to this field. It is easy to get lose track of time for me but I also take breaks when needed. I fell like that might contribute to a lack of other responsibilities as well though. I have downloaded the pomodoro chrome extension and I have been working on incorporating it into my routine. The other night I was stuck on something in the homework and I went to make dinner and figured it out almost as soon as I got back which felt great though so I do understand the necessity for periodic breaks.

You've probably heard of the Pomodoro Technique in Mod 0 classes (and elsewhere, maybe!). During this final section of the project, we are going to ask that you follow this technique. Please read about it [here](https://www.dovico.com/blog/2020/08/26/the-pomodoro-technique-how-to-manage-your-work-time-and-flow-the-easy-way/). 

The article doesn't mention writing down Step 1 (`Decide on the task to be performed`), but we ask that you find a special spot in your notebook where you do this for each work session. In the deliverables, we will ask that you share what you wrote down for Step 1 of the technique each time you started a new task.

_Note: if the 25 minutes on/3-5 minutes off isn't best for you, you do **not** have to follow that! The main focus of this is setting an intention and continuing to better understand your working style._

## Part B: Arrays and Hashes

Today you will learn about two common data types: Arrays and Hashes.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then push your work to GitHub.

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory. 
    - [X] Read about what an [array](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex32.html) is from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] Learn how arrays are [index-based](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex34.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] [Hashes](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex39.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] [Hashes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#8.-hashes) from Ruby in 100 minutes.

1. [X] Work through the `arrays.rb` file in the section3/exercises directory.

1. [X]Work through the `hashes.rb` file in the section3/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the section3 directory.

## Reflection

üìù Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the `section3` directory.

## Commit Your Work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section3` activities, use the Git workflow and commands you've learned to add and commit your work. Write a commit message that concisely summarizes what work this commit contains. Use your resources if you need a refresher on how to do this.

## Push to GitHub

Push your code to your remote repository. Visit your GitHub repository to verify the work you did for this section was pushed successfully!
