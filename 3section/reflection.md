## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It changed quite drastically, though I do think it would be more beneficial to have a pomodoro timer on my phoen than my compouter as the point is to get up and move around.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I overestimated the 5 minute breaks but as far as intentions go I believe I am outperforming my usual routine and procrastinating a lot less.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a list of data you can pull so use in other arguments. It can combine multiple variables but unlike an array it does not list items in order so you can't draw data from it in that fashion.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {dog_food: 0, cat_food: 1, turtle_toys: 2, fish_leashes: 3}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states.values[1]`
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`
`states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
I think when you need to keep a living index and have information being attached or added throughout it's life span a hash would be far more beneficial. If several paleontologists are working on an excavation site and contributing their findings to one document I think a hash or a subsequent hashes under an array would be far more beneficial than arrays alone. I do feel in most circumstances if you want to get the most out of your application you would need to use both.


8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
The evolution of hashes and the ability to manipulate them to add and take aaway information is really exciting and though I'm not sure the exact question to ask now i'm sure I will formulate it or discover the answer in the near future.
