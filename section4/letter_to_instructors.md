## Letter to Instructors

Howdy'all,

My name is Taryn Germaine Orlemann (she/her). I am changing my career to change up my life. I like change. If I go for too long without change, I become depressed and repressed. I liked what I was doing well enough, but well enough wasn't enough. I can see no reason why anyone should just do the same thing for 40+ years of their life. I wanted to feel excited and engaged again. Learning something new will add value to my entire life, not just my career. I also feel somewhat confident I can be good at this. 

#### Strengths that I can contribute:
- I am diplomatic and compassionate. I am told I am a great teacher.
- While I have room to grow, I am a decent problem solver and look forward to helping others work through obstacles.
- I am tenacious and have a good attention to detail and especially when it comes to editing - I imagine will come in handy in refactoring/debugging
- I can usually remain calm when faced with stress

#### Values, working styles, etc.:
I am thoughtful and deliberate - which is slow and sometimes conflicts with deadlines. I need to remind myself that perfection is an illusion. I value truth - so don't hold anything back! 



I already knew this about myself, but discipline and accountability (to myself) are not my strong suits. I did come to a realization however, about how I have managed stressful situations - or situations that others my find stressful but historically I have been able to feel calm in the midst of the pressure. I am able to compartmentalize a situation as a point in time, which allows me to disasssociate from it to a degree, and not think about it except as a point in time that will pass. When I don't think about it, I can keep worries/anxities from my mind that might otherwise build up. All the other points in time that precede it, are their own points in time that also pass. So the situation cannot become it's own entity (a sum of parts: concerns, deadlines, dangers, all the other points in time leading up to it etc.).
I realized i could apply this to project work as well, if I can be more disciplined and accountable. If I can break up a project into small parts = chunks of time that will pass. If I am steady in my work, and don't meander or skip these chunks of work time, then I won't approach a deadline worrying about time I've squandered. I can be confident as deadlines approach knowing that I did my best. And then the deadline itself becomes like any other momemt in time - it passes as nothing to worry about.
