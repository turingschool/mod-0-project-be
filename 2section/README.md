# Section 2 - GROWTH MINDSET, Conditionals

Section 2 is estimated to take a total of 8-12 hours to complete. Similar to Section 1, this section of the project involves üìíreading, üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline.

## Vocabulary

This section will introduce a number of new terms, that may feel a bit more complex. Write these terms in that special spot in your notebook now. Work to hold yourself accountable to updating definitions _as you work through this section_.

- if statements
- method

## Get Set Up

Using the Terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the project repository. If you are having trouble with this, see the `section1` instructions.

## Part A: Growth Mindset

Read/watch one or both of the following:
- This [2-part blog post series](https://blog.mindsetworks.com/entry/how-having-a-growth-mindset-can-help-you-learn-to-code) discusses how having a growth mindset is helpful when learning to code, and how coding promotes a growth mindset!
- This [video interview](https://dev.to/hackflix_dev/how-to-hack-a-growth-mindset-b1g) where an experienced Front-End engineer discusses learning about the concept of Growth Mindset and how that's changed how she sees her work and career. (The first 7 minutes are intros and a discussion on Developer Relations. After that, the conversation about Growth Midnset begins.)

Then, consider on the following questions. We will ask you to share some of these responses at the end of this section.
- What are two points from the article or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I think the concept of a growth mindset (being malleable and not stuck as who you are) can be a stark contrast from the feelings that people have from poor family lives. There will always be times in a growth journey in which you stumble or fall, and for people previously referenced, thay may feel that it's biological because their parents or other relatives have similarly failed. This is something i've workeds to repair for a long time and although I am wary, it can still be difficult to approach at times. The world of software development is also constantly changing (which is something that I'm excited about from this field) and the way we approach eachother as human beings and being aware of eachothers hardships might conflict with personal bias. A growth mindset is imperative for both quality work in our career and quality relationships with our peers. 

- In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I love learning and I've taken a huge risk by going to Turing in order to change my life and get into a field I'm passionate about. I struggle applying myself to my best capability, espescially over long periods of time, but the pomodoro technique (and subsequent chrome extension) has been an incredible help. I am also terrible at note taking and calendaring but I have no doubt Turing will aid me to develop those skills and I do take them seriously.

- What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?
I have worked with unmanned aircraft for six years but when I got to my current job (Ground Control Software Technician) I was introduced to Linux Red Hat. Most UAV platforms are powered by GNU Linux but their configurations are different and I had previoiusly done more aircraft maintenance than software technician work. I was under the impression after two weeks that I was going to get fired and couldn't keep that job because no one could answer questions we had and referred to it as, "tribal knowledge" but that tribe had apparemntly moved on from the last contract (go figure). But after some time and a little bit of using big technical words to sound like I knew a lot more than I did (and a lot of Googling) I developed a good reputation and a quality understanding of how the system operated and how to fix it when it decided not to. It was devastatingly terrifying for months but now it feels stale and I want to pursue something I'm passionate about. 

## Part B: Conditionals

One of the most important concepts in computer programming is knowing when and how to tell the computer to do either _one_ thing or _another_ thing based on a set of simple criteria.  We accomplish this with ***If-Statements*** and ***Conditionals***, which you will learn about today.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to GitHub.

### If statement and Conditional Lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    - [X] [What If?](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex29.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] [Else and If](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex30.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] [Making Decisions](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex31.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [X] [Conditionals](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#9.-conditionals) from Ruby in 100 Minutes.

1. [X] Work through the `if_statements.rb` file in the `section2/exercises` directory.

## Vocabulary

Look back at that special spot in your notebook for vocabulary. Hopefully you updated it with definitions, diagrams, and code samples as you went through this section. If not, do so now. This will be part of this sections deliverables.

## Reflections

üìù Answer the prompts in the `reflection.md` file in the `section2` directory. If you need a reminder on how to format your markdown, [this is the Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!

## Commit Your Work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section2` activities, use the Terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local Git repository.

1. `git add section2/exercises`
2. `git add section2/reflection.md`
3. `git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
4. `git commit -m "Add Section 2 work"`

## Push to GitHub

You've saved your work to Git on your local machine, but your repository on GitHub doesn't reflect it yet. You update the remote GitHub repository with your new local commits when you `push` your changes.

Run:

```
git push origin main
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote repository and see all the work you did in this section!
