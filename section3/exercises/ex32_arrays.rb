# same as above , but in a more Ruby Style
# this and the next one are the preferred
# way Ruby for-loops are written
fruits.each do |fruit|

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# note this is yet another style, exactly like above
# but a different syntax (way to write it)
change.each {|i| puts "I got #{i}"}

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts
(0..5).each do |i|
  puts "adding #{i} to the list."
  # changed to use shovel operator
  elements << i
end

# now we can print them out too
elements.each {|i| puts "Element was: #{i}"}
