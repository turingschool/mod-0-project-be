# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

#-------------------
# PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
#-------------------

# EXAMPLE: write code below that will print an array of animals.
# Store the array in a variable.
animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]
print animals

# EXAMPLE: Write code below that will print "Zebra" from the animals array
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts ""
puts animals[0]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in array of
# animals from above.
puts ""
puts animals.count

# YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
# array to "Gorilla"
puts ""
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
puts "position 2 has been changed to #{animals[2]}"
puts ""
# YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Fish")
print animals
puts ""
puts ""

# YOU DO: Write code that will print the String "Elephant" in the animals array
puts animals[2]
puts "the string 'elephant' was replaced by 'Gorilla' as instructed in line 32-33'..."
puts ""
#-------------------
# PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
#-------------------

# YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

foods = ["pizza", "pasta", "burgers", "pudding"]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in the array of
# foods from above.

puts "There are #{foods.count} elements in the array 'foods'"

# YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

foods.push("broccoli")
puts "new array: #{foods}"

# YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify that item has been removed
puts ""
foods.pop
puts "new array: #{foods}"
puts ""

# YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  # There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
# Then, print the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift("ice cream")
foods.push("oranges")
foods.push("hot dogs")
print foods
puts ""
puts ""
# YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift
print foods
puts ""
puts ""

# PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
#-------------------


# Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
# This is why programming languages have arrays!

# One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
# associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list, or, array.

# The post itself likely has more complex data, but here is one way we can think about it:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"]

# YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
# may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
# all from the same one.

# 1:
genres = ["Electronic", "Jazz", "Classical"]
# 2:
message_folders = ["college friends", "family", "coworkers", "school"]
# 3:
piano_music_folders = ["pieces to learn", "pieces learned"]
