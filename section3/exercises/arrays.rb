#-------------------
# PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
#-------------------

# EXAMPLE: write code below that will print an array of animals.
# Store the array in a variable.

animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]
print animals

# EXAMPLE: Write code below that will print "Zebra" from the animals array
# YOUR CODE HERE

print animals[0]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in array of
#animals from above.

print animals.count

# YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
# array to "Gorilla"

animals[2] = "Gorilla"
print animals

# YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals << "Tiger"
print animals

# YOU DO: Write code that will print the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals.unshift "Elephant"
print animals

#-------------------
# PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
#-------------------

# YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

foods = ["Pizza", "Tacos", "Lasagna", "Ice cream"]
print foods

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in the array of
# foods from above.

print foods.count

# YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

foods.unshift "Broccoli"
print foods

# YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify that item has been removed

foods.pop
print foods

# YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  # There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
# Then, print the changed array to verify the new items have been added

foods.push("Cheese cake", "Burrito", "Chicken")
print foods
# YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift
print foods

#-------------------
# PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
#-------------------


# Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
# This is why programming languages have arrays!

# One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
# associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list, or, array.

# The post itself likely has more complex data, but here is one way we can think about it:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"]

# YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
# may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
# all from the same one.

# 1: On facebook your friends list would be a good example of an array, contantly changing addind and deleting variables
# 2: On imdb the arrays are gonna be used to track the actors in the movies/shows as well as tracking the best movies
# 3: On youtube there can be an array for every person you subscribe to and any of the "for you" lists that youtube creates
# based on what you watch while on the app
