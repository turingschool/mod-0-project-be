# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result.

# Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
# any remaining prompt.

# To check your work, run this file by entering the following
# command in your terminal:
# `ruby section3/exercises/arrays.rb``


#-------------------
# PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
#-------------------

# EXAMPLE: write code below that will print an array of animals.
# Store the array in a variable.
animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]
print animals

# EXAMPLE: Write code below that will print "Zebra" from the animals array
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts animals[0]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in array of
# animals from above.
puts animals.length

# YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
# array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla"

# YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Crow")

# YOU DO: Write code that will print the String "Elephant" in the animals array
#Elephants was reassigned earlier so it will print the animal in the indexed location
puts animals[2]

#-------------------
# PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
#-------------------

# YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
food = ["apple", "orange", "chicken", "rice"]

# YOU DO: Write code below that will print the number of elements in the array of
# foods from above.
puts food.length

# YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
puts "-" * 10
food.push("broccoli")
food.each do |item|
  puts item
end

# YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
# print the changed array to verify that item has been removed
puts "-" *10
food.pop
puts food

# YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  # There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
# Then, print the changed array to verify the new items have been added
puts "-" * 10
food.push("carrot", "Oreo", "onion")
puts food

# YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift
#-------------------
# PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
#-------------------


# Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
# This is why programming languages have arrays!

# One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
# associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list, or, array.

# The post itself likely has more complex data, but here is one way we can think about it:


posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"]

# YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
# may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
# all from the same one.

# Udisc is an app used by disc golfers to find new courses and keep score while you are playing.
# 1: Udisc uses arrays to store reviews for disc golf courses
# 2: Udisc also may use arrays to store my scores from past rounds.  It would
#    likely use an array to store my result on each hole as well as overall score
# 3: Udisc also likely uses an array to store the list of courses in the area
#    although a hash map might be used due to all the extra info they would likey want together
