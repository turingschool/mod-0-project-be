# same as above, but in a more Ruby style
# this and the next one are the preferred
# way Ruby for-loops are written

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# note this is yet another style, exactly like above
# but a different syntax (way to write it).

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts

# now we can print them out too
