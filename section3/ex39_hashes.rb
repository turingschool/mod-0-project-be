#1. Do this same kind of mapping with cities and states/regions in your country or some other country.
  states = {
    'Colorado' => 'CO',
    'Illinois' => 'IL',
    'Washington' => 'WA',
    'North Carolina' => 'NC',
    'South Carolina' => 'SC'
  }

  cities = {
    'WA' => 'Seattle',
    'NC' => 'Jacksonville',
    'SC' => 'Charleston'
  }

  cities['CO'] = 'Denver'
  cities['IL'] = 'Chicago'

  puts '-' * 10
  puts "CO state has: #{cities['CO']}"
  puts "IL state has: #{cities['IL']}"

  puts '-' * 10
  puts "Washington's abbreviation is: #{states['Washington']}"
  puts "North Carolina's abbreviation is: #{states['North Carolina']}"

  puts '-' * 10
  puts "South Carolina has: #{cities[states['South Carolina']]}"
  puts "North Carolina has: #{cities[states['North Carolina']]}"

  puts '-' * 10
  states.each do |state, abbrev|
    city = cities[abbrev]
    puts "#{state} is abbreviated #{abbrev} and has city #{city}"
  end

#2. Find the Ruby documentation for hashes and try to do even more things to them.
  kay = {
    'First name' => 'Kaelin',
    'Last name' => 'Sleevi',
    'Age' => 23,
    'Nationality' => 'Irish',
    'Nickname' => 'Kay'
  }

  kay.each do |key, value|
    puts kay[key]
  end

  grades = {
    'Jane Doe' => 10,
    'Jim Doe' => 6
  }

  options = {
    font_size: 1,
    font_family: 'Arial'
  }

  grades.each do |key, value|
    puts grades[key]
  end

  options.each do |key, value|
    puts options[key]
  end

  grades = Hash.new
  grades['Dororthy Doe'] = 9

  grades = Hash.new(0)

  grades = {'Timmy Doe'=> 10}
  grades.default = 0

  puts grades['Jane Doe']
  puts grades['Jim Doe']
  puts grades['Dorothy Doe']
  puts grades['Timmy Doe']

#3. Find out what you can't do with hashes. A big one is that they do not have order, so try playing with that.
    #- Apparently, as of Ruby version 1.9 hashes maintain an order in which they are stored. But it can not tore data in a specific order.
    #- We also cannot rely on just an index number to look or call the hashes out, so we use keys.
