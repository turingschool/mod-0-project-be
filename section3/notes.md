•	Array
a container of things that are organized in order from first to last
ex. hairs = ['brown', 'blond', 'red']
You start the array with the [ (left bracket) which "opens" the array. Then you put each item you want in the array separated by commas, similar to function arguments. Lastly, end the array with a ] (right bracket) to indicate that it's over. Ruby then takes this array and all its contents and assigns them to the variable.
you can only use numbers to get items out of a array.

•	Hash
 like an array but you use anything, not just numbers as your index.  A hash is used to map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them. A hash in Ruby is just like a dictionary in the real world - mapping a word to its definition.  "mapping" or "associating" is the key concept in a hash

 What is the difference between an array and a hash?
 A array is for an ordered array of items. A hash (or hash) is for matching some items (called "keys") to other items (called "values").

 What would I use a hash for?
When you have to take one value and "look up" another value. In fact, you could call hashes "look up tables."
What would I use an array for?
Use an array for any sequence of things that need to be in order, and you only need to look them up by a numeric index.

When creating a hash the key and value are linked by the => symbol which is called a rocket. So hashes start with a curly bracket {, have zero or more entries made up of a key, a rocket, and a value separated by commas, then end with a closing curly bracket }.
