Study Dirlls
1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you cannot pick years at random.)
  - The year 2010 really is 2010 and not 2009 because the start of the century begins at a 2000 just like the arrays starting at 0 the century started at 0 as well.
2. Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
  - meals = ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'desert']

  - puts "The first (1st) meal of the day is at 0 and is #{meals[0]}"
  - puts "The meal at 0 is the 1st meal and is #{meals[0]}"

  - puts "The second (2nd) meal of the day is at 1 and is #{meals[1]}"
  - puts "The meal at 1 is the 2nd meal and is #{meals[1]}"

  - puts "The third (3rd) meal of the day is at 2 and is #{meals[2]}"
  - puts "The meal at 2 is the 3rd meal and is #{meals[2]}"

  - puts "The fourth (4th) meal of the day is at 3 and is #{meals[3]}"
  - puts "The meal at 3 is the 4th meal and is #{meals[3]}"
