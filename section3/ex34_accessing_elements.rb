#Study Dirlls
#1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you cannot pick years at random.)
  #- The year 2010 really is 2010 and not 2009 because the start of the century begins at a 2000 just like the arrays starting at 0 the century started at 0 as well.
#2. Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
  meals = ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'desert']

  puts "The first (1st) meal of the day is at 0 and is #{meals[0]}"

  puts "The second (2nd) meal of the day is at 1 and is #{meals[1]}"
  puts "The meal at 1 is the 2nd meal and is #{meals[1]}"

  puts "The third (3rd) meal of the day is at 2 and is #{meals[2]}"
  puts "The meal at 2 is the 3rd meal and is #{meals[2]}"

  puts "The fourth (4th) meal of the day is at 3 and is #{meals[3]}"
