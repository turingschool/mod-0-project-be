## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * My work flow felt over all smoother this week. The Pomodoro technique is helpful but I need to be better
  at utilizing it.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * I realized that my goals we're loose and lofty. I set myself up for failure by setting an idealized large goal rather than more attainable and realistic ones throughout my day. That being said, I think after setting that intention, I was able to get a lot closer to the goal rather than when it was
  even more loosly constructed in my mind.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
I like to think of a Hash as a variable that houses a list of other variables. An array is an ordered list, and there is no order to a hash, just the keys that associated to values.  

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {toys: 50, cats: 11, gerbils :28, treats: 112}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

puts "#{states[:IA]}"

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
puts states.keys
puts states.values
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
I think anytime you're dealing with inventories a hash would be beneficial over an array because you need the integer values associated to the keys. A list of just the keys or values isn't very useful in this case.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Why are we taught multiple syntax for creating hashes? Seems one would be better than the other almost always.
