## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I started using a youtube Study with me channel to implement the Pomodoro technique and I feel I can focus better after each small break.
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found myself more focused as I am more aware of how much each task actually takes.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a name; whereas array is a number-indexed list of data.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
'pet_store = {"puppies"=>5, "kittens"=>3, "hamsters"=>10}'
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys` and `states.values`
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We might use hash when making an inventory of goods/products. Hash stores more organized information than arrays and makes it easily accessible.
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I cannot think of anything for now.
