## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I actually started using the Pomodoro technique from the beginning, but I do like it. I never really used it before starting with Turing. More on that in the next question!

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I think the Pomodoro technique is actually a lot more helpful than I thought. I figured that the constant breaks would interrupt my train of thought and derail me, but it was quite the opposite. A forced short break every now and then actually helped me focus more in the long-run.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A Hash is a way to store data values and be able to call them with keys. The main difference from an Array is that a Hash is unordered data, meaning that it does not technically have a logical index that you can call info from like you can with an Array. Instead you use the keys that I mentioned before.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {cat_food: 10, dog_food: 15, cat_toys: 45, dog_toys: 54}`

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

To access value "Iowa": `states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

To get all keys: `states.keys`
To get all values: `states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A hash would probably be best for storing music on a streaming music service. This would be better than an array because you could store individual bits of info for each song like Artist, Song Title, Track Number, Album, etc.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I actually spent a pretty decent amount of time looking into hashes, but one of the things I haven't looked up yet is how you can take data from a hash, extract it, and put into another array or hash, perhaps in a different order. I know it's possible, but I have a feeling that this is where linking to a database would possibly be a more efficient way of doing this.
